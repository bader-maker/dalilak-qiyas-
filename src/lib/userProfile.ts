/**
 * Persistent user profile — long-running, cross-session aggregate of the
 * student's practice performance, stored under the `user_profile`
 * localStorage key.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from `TrainingContext`:
 *   - TrainingContext (`dalilak_training_state`) keeps a per-question
 *     history meant for the in-app training engine. It does NOT track
 *     hint usage and isn't a focused, easily-consumable snapshot.
 *   - This module exposes the FIVE specific signals the rest of the app
 *     needs to make smarter training & recommendation decisions:
 *       1. strongest topics
 *       2. weakest topics
 *       3. average accuracy
 *       4. average speed (seconds per question)
 *       5. hint usage rate
 *
 * Storage shape (versioned for safe migrations):
 *   {
 *     version: 1,
 *     updatedAt: <epoch ms of last update>,
 *     sessionsCompleted: <number of finished training sessions>,
 *     totals: {
 *       answered, correct, timeSeconds (sum of timed answers),
 *       timedAnswered (denom for averageSpeed),
 *       hintsUsed
 *     },
 *     topics: {
 *       [topic]: { answered, correct, timeSeconds, timedAnswered, hintsUsed }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * The derived snapshot (`summarizeProfile`) computes the five signals from
 * the raw counters. We deliberately store COUNTERS, not pre-computed rates,
 * so future signal changes don't require migrating historical data.
